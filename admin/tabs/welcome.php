       <h3> <?php _e('Helping the Community','wp-ticket-ultra'); ?></h3>
     
          <p class="wptu-extended-p">This plugin has been developed for people that need to improve their support services. As a plugin developer, we know how hard it can be to offer high-quality support to your clients. A public forum might be a good option; however, this often leads to bigger problems when you are trying to support a growing business. We've gone through this experience, and that's why we developed WP Ticket Ultra. This plugin has helped us a lot, and it has drastically improved our client relations and increased increasing our overall profits.</p>
          
           <p class="wptu-extended-p">We’re very sure that this plugin will help you to offer a top-notch support service to your current and future clients. The lite version is very powerful and it will work well for small companies. If you’re selling one product then this is the right product because you can create different departments such as sales, technical, refunds, etc. </p>
           
            <p class="wptu-extended-p">If you need to offer support for more than one product, or if you need to allow your staff members to reply to the client’s inquiries, then check out our advanced version of WP Ticket Ultra. </p>
            
             <p class="wptu-extended-p">Whether you are using our completely free lite version, or have opted for our paid advanced version, we would like to thank you for taking the time to install WP Ticket Ultra.
